Metropolis
Messaging-based microservice framework using CNCFâ€™s NATS Message

Written in Python

Purpose
Microservice architecture is complementing the shortcomings of traditional monolithic service architecture, and as solutions (containers, orchestrators) for managing workloads on a smaller scale emerge, it is gradually becoming a common architectural pattern. 

there is.

However, in order to efficiently manage still separate microservices, concepts (Discovery, Governance, Service Mesh) required in addition to experience in operating traditional monolithic services are becoming important.

We will create a simple message-based microservice framework using CNCF ecosystem tools, run the service, and present a method to manage and develop services more efficiently in a Cloud Native environment.
